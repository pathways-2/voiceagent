Project Description
An intelligent voice AI agent that handles incoming phone calls for local restaurant chains, automating reservations, answering frequently asked questions, and providing customer support through natural conversation. The system integrates with existing restaurant operations (calendars, messaging) to create a seamless customer experience.
Problem Statement
Local restaurants lose revenue from missed calls, have limited staff for phone support, and struggle with after-hours booking requests. Manual reservation management is inefficient and prone to double-bookings or missed opportunities.
Solution Overview
Deploy an AI voice assistant that operates 24/7, handles routine inquiries, books reservations in real-time, and maintains customer communication through automated confirmations and reminders.
Use case target : Local restaurant “Sylvie’s kitchen”. Agent pick ups all, handels questions on restaurant policy, menu items, hours and reservations.
